# our user.name is always the same, but user.email differs between work and
# personal repositories, so force an explicit decision to be made about what
# email address is used for the commits by instructing git to only use config
# (never infer), but leaving it unset for the global case
# note: this requires git 2.8.0 to work

# gpg without any specified key and lets gpg make the decision (which is

# than the newest key).  since we are only at this time signing with the one
# key, this isn't an issue and we just set it globally, but really (TODO) git
# should be changed so that user.useConfigOnly really requires config for
# *every* user.* variable in the whole namespace
